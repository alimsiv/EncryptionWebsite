          It's nice to see you, but you are a little early to the party! This site is still in early development, 
          so certain features are not quite implemented yet. I'd love your feedback, but I haven't implemented 
          that quite yet either. 
        </p>
        <hr />

          This site is being actively developed, so please check back soon to see what has changed! 
        </p>
